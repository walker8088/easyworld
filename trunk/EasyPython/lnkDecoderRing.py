#
#   Requirements(Dependencies):  Install Python, and wxPython.
#
#   Tested On Windows, Linux, Mac OS X
#
#   Icons taken from "Klassic New Crisp Icons" by Asif Ali Rizwaan (therizwaan) from the KDE-LOOK site (some edited a bit).
#   A humble and excellent artist.
#   Oh, the python icon is taken from wxPython.
#   The basic design of the program is meant to roughly (ROUGHLY) mimick DrScheme.
#   The purpose is the same, to provide a simple IDE(integrated development environment) ideal for teaching.
#   The DrPython icon itself was based on the DrScheme icon, with a slightly edited wxpython icon inserted(note yellow tongue, googly eyes).
#
#   This program could not have been written without the wonderful work of the people behind
#   python and wxPython, in particular the Styled Text Control.  Thank you.  Hopefully this tool will be of use.

#This loverly little file
#let's people grab file attributes from the
#.lnk file format (windows shortcut).
#
#It does not require any libraries external to python.

# Adapted from the excellent perl code found in smb2web.
