                            Added OnSelect event to ComboBox.  Also changed
                            default value to "" (old value didn't play well
                            with readonly-ness).
                            
                            Added 'process_enter' argument to TextBox.

                            Added 'size' argument to Splitter.
                            NoteBook now has real size rather than (-1,-1).
                            
0.1.25      2003.09.01      Added Frame.SetIcon().

0.1.26      2003.09.02      Added TextEntryDialog.

0.1.27      2003.09.05      shell.py now works with Python 2.3 and wxPython
                            2.4.1.2.
                            Added keys.py with keys class.
                            
0.1.28      2003.09.08      Files use the new wx namespace.  Changes done by
                            Tom Ayerst.
                            Importing core.py now automatically checks for
                            correct wxPython version.
                            
0.1.29      2003.09.11      Added dragdrop.py, with FileDropTarget class.

0.1.30      2003.09.17      Added first version of TreeView.

0.1.31      2003.09.22      Label.__init__ grows an 'align' parameter.
                            Added FontDialog.
                            Added inject.py, which meddles with Wax classes to
                            replace certain methods.  First attempt is to
                            replace GetFont with a version that returns wax
                            Fonts rather than wxFonts.
                            
0.1.32      2003.09.25      Fixed bug in fontdialog.py.
                            Added keys class to __init__.  Fixed a few keys.
                            StyledTextBox: Added a number of cursor methods.
                            
0.1.33      2003.09.27      Added some methods to StyledTextBox, to make
                            setting of styles and fonts easier.  (For example,
                            it now supports the SetFont method, like most
                            other controls.)
                            
0.1.34      2003.09.28      Added some more style stuff to StyledTextBox.

0.1.35      2003.10.01      Added __future__ import to treeview.py.
                            Renamed container.py to containers.py.
                            Added GridContainer to containers.py.  Added
                            GridPanel and GridFrame.
                            
0.1.36      2003.10.15      Dialogs can now be cancelled by pressing Escape.
                            Code by Tom Ayerst.
                            
0.1.36a     2003.10.29      Tiny checkin: TextBox.OnText event added.  (First
                            code contribution by Ken Kennedy.)
                            
0.1.37      2003.11.24      Added OverlaySizer, OverlayContainer, OverlayPanel.
                            (Only the last one is published in __init__.py, and
                            will be the basis for a Wizard control.)
                            
0.1.38      2003.11.24      Added left/right alignment to Container.  (For some
                            reason these were left out.)
                            Added expand/stretch/etc flags for OverlayContainer's
                            AddComponent.
                            
0.1.39      2003.11.25      Added CheckBox.

0.1.40      2003.11.25      Added RadioButton.
                            Added first, incomplete versions of GroupBox and 
                            GroupBoxContainer.
                            Fixed GridContainer, which had some issues with
                            (x, y) "coordinates".
                            
0.1.41      2003.11.27      Renamed TreeView.GetChildren to GetChildNodes.
                            (GetChildren would shadow wxWindow.GetChildren.)
                            Added TreeView.HasChildren.
                            Added NoteBook.GetCurrentPage.

0.1.42      2003.11.27      Added TreeView.SetImageList, SetItemImage.
                            Added ImageList.
                            Added ListView.SetImageList.
                            Added FileTreeView.
                            
0.1.42a     2003.12.10      Import of togglebutton is now conditional (it
                            is not imported on the Mac, where it apparently
                            isn't available).
                            
0.1.43      2003.12.13      Added MDIChildFrame, MDIParentFrame, BitmapButton.
                            Code by Gandalf.  (The MDI code is untested, but the
                            BitmapButton code has been extended and an example
                            was added.)
                            
0.1.44      2003.12.14      Added Frame.OnClose event.

0.1.44a     2004.01.08      Some small bugfixes in Mac recognition and keys.py.

0.1.44b     2004.01.12      Added 'ruby' and 'groovy' to styledtextbox.languages.

0.1.44c     2004.01.19      Some slight changes... most notably, Dialog's
                            OK button can now be reached as self.okbutton.
                            
0.1.44d     2004.01.20      Added core.Yield() to TextBox.write(), allowing for
                            screen updates after writing.

0.1.45      2004.01.23      Added waxobject.SetSizeX and SetSizeY.

0.1.46      2004.02.17      Fixed bug with OnPageChanging in NoteBook. 
                            Fixed bug with default argument for parent in
                            Panel.
                            Fixed bug in ListBox. (Bugfix by Eric Ziegenhorn.)

0.1.47      2004.02.18      Bugfix: ListView.InsertRow should also take non-
                            strings (and convert them to strings when passing
                            to SetStringItem()).
                            Added ListView.SetColumnWidths().
                            
                            Added FlexGridContainer, -Panel and -Frame.  Some
                            testing is in order.
                            Fixed some warts in GridContainer.
                            Added some examples for the grid containers.
                            
0.1.48      2004.02.19      Removed 'title' attribute from Panels, because it's
                            useless.
                            Added 'tools' subdirectory.  Nothing in there yet,
                            but some high-level controls (dialogs, probably)
                            will be moved there.  Importing is *not* done
                            automatically; use "from wax.tools import Blah".
                            
0.1.49      2004.02.20      TextEntryDialog now takes a default value.
                            MessageDialog.__init__'s 'icon' parameter now takes
                            a string (default "") indicating the type of icon
                            that should be displayed.
                            
0.1.50      2004.02.22      Added TaskBarIcon.
                            Added Frame.OnIconize event.
                            Added example to illustrate use of TaskBarIcon.
                            (Based on code found at Norfolk Graphics,
                             http://norfolkgraphics.com/python.php.)
                            
0.2.0       2004.04.02      (interim release for compatibility with 2.5.1.2)
                            If a Frame has no parent, it is indicated by None
                            rather than wx.NULL.
                            Ditto for FlexGridFrame and GridFrame.
                            Namespace changes for shell.py and simpleeditor.py.
                            Changed examples/canvas1.py and canvas2.py (DC 
                            changes).
                            ChoiceDialog: OnListBoxDoubleClick now passes
                            event to OnClickOKButton.
                            TreeView: wx.TreeView.GetFirstChild changed, changed
                            GetChildNodes to reflect this.
                            wx.Sizer.Add now takes a tuple (w, h) or a control
                            as its first argument, prompting changes in 
                            containers.AddComponent.
                            
(0.2.1)     2004.04.08      Added wax.core.CallAfter.
                
(0.2.2)     2004.04.28      Added StyledTextBox.GetValue.
            
(0.2.3)     2004.05.05      Added Canvas.OnClick event.
            
0.2.4       2004.05.16      Applied patch to Container and GroupBoxContainer,
                            contributed by Grant Edwards.
                            There are two groupbox*.py examples now that work.

0.2.5       2004.05.16      Added a metaclass construct for WaxObject, allowing
                            us to add an attribute __events__ to control
                            classes, which automatically creates event methods.
                            Currently only implemented in Button, for testing
                            purposes.
                            
0.2.6       2004.05.17      Added core.DEBUG for easy turning on/off of debug
                            messages (first of which is in MetaWaxObject).
                            Another GroupBox/GroupBoxContainer fix by Grant
                            Edwards; this time it allows GroupBox to be used as
                            a parent (unlike wx.StaticBox in wxPython, and
                            unlike the old GroupBox).
                            
0.2.7       2004.05.17      Souped up colordb.py, so it doesn't have to parse
                            the multiline string with colors anymore.
                            Changed methods to accept color name as well as
                            an RGB tuple.
                            Added SetForegroundColor, SetBackgroundColor (sic!)
                            to WaxObject.  These methods accept color names as
                            well, as demonstrated in the new demo file
                            colored-buttondemo-1.py.
                            Also added WaxObject.GetAllChildren(), which
                            recursively loops over widgets and their children,
                            returning a generator producing a list of all 
                            children, grandchildren, etc.
                            
0.2.8       2004.05.18      Added TextBox.OnKeyUp.
                            Changed parameter order in GridContainer._create_sizer
                            to match wx.GridSizer.
                            
0.2.9       2004.05.20      menu.py: Added GetItem (which returns a wx.MenuItem
                            rather than an id); Delete (which now accepts a
                            wx.MenuItem as well as an id).
                            Added tools/menuhistory.py, the first file in the
                            tools directory.  (The MenuHistory object allows
                            you to easily plug a "recent files" history into
                            a menu.)
                            
0.2.10      2004.05.21      More patches by Grant Edwards:
                            - Button grows 'border' and 'exactfit' parameters
                            - Label grows 'noresize' parameter.
                            INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: errordialog.py moved to tools
                            directory.  
                            
(...)       2004.05.26      Added Frame.OnShow, Frame.OnActivate.
            
(...)       2004.05.27      Added Frame.OnIdle.
                            Added core.WakeUpIdle and tinkered with generation
                            of functions.
                            
(...)       2004.06.02      Added (optional) use_stdout_window argument to
                            Application.__init__.  When set, the app uses the
                            stdout/stderr window.
                            
0.2.11      2004.06.10      Added WAX_VERSION_TUPLE.

0.2.12      2004.06.11      Added pseudo-properties.  (obj.XXX is a shorthand
                            for obj.GetXXX(), and obj.XXX = something is a
                            shorthand for obj.SetXXX(something).)

0.2.13      2004.06.19      EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE.
                            The dreaded change of the event system.  Events
                            are no longer bound to empty methods.  Rather, they
                            are bound on demand.  If a class definition has a
                            method OnXXX, where XXX is a valid event name,
                            then that method is automatically bound to the
                            appropriate event by BindEvents().  Ditto if OnXXX
                            is dynamically added to an instance.
                            
                            May be buggy.  Known issues with OnPaint, which is
                            already defined for most (all?) controls.  For this
                            reason it's not in events.py's events list (yet).
                            Neither are many other events, until this new
                            system has been proven reliable.
                            
0.2.14      2004.06.21      Added OnEnter and OnExit (OnLeave) events.
                            Added PlainContainer, PlainFrame and PlainPanel.
                            
0.2.15      2004.06.28      Minor change in Frame.__init__.
                            Fixed bug with recursion in WaxObject.__getattr__.

0.2.16      2004.06.28      Menu.Append now returns the item that was added.
                            Ditto for Menu.AppendMenu.
                            
0.2.17      2004.06.29      Added HTMLWindow.  Added examples for Notebook and
                            HTMLWindow.
                            Added core.SafeYield, BeginBusyCursor and 
                            EndBusyCursor.
                            
0.2.18      2004.06.30      Added OnSize, OnResize, OnMove events (global).
                            Added OnGetFocus, OnLoseFocus (note that these
                            names differ from what wxPython calls them).
                            Added tab_traversal keyword argument to the
                            __init__s of the Frame classes.
                            
0.2.19      2004.06.30      Added TextBox.GetCurrentLineNumber().
                            Added a bunch of events to StyledTextBox.
                            
0.2.20      2004.07.01      In anticipation of future wxPython releases, the
                            current way of setting fonts in WaxConfig.default_font
                            now causes a warning.  The new, approved method is
                            to use a tuple: 
                            
                              WaxConfig.default_font = ("Courier New", 10)
                            
0.2.21      2004.07.06      Removed EVT_STC_POSCHANGED event (OnPosChanged).
                            Apparently this will be removed in wxPython 2.5.2.
                            'OnUpdateUI' can be used instead.
                            (There will be more incompatible changes in 2.5.2...
                            apparently some people don't care much about
                            keeping code backward compatible.)
                            
                            Added GetForegroundColor, GetBackgroundColor.
                            Changed GridContainer.__getitem__ to return control
                            rather than dict.
                            Added cancel_button parameter to TextEntryDialog.
                            Added a first version of MaskedTextBox, but it's
                            not in __init__.py yet.  It may not stay.
                            Added sound.py.
                            
                            INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES: choicedialog.py moved to
                            tools directory.  Changed example to reflect this.
                            
0.2.22      2004.07.07      Added injection methods to MetaWaxObject... SetFont,
                            and SetBackgroundColour & friends.
                            Removed WaxObject.get_size and set_size.  (Did
                            anybody use these?)
                            
0.2.23      2004.07.22      Added new parameters for 'expand' in AddComponent
                            (horizontal, vertical, or both).  Currently only
                            for Panel, Frame and any container whose
                            AddComponent uses Container.AddComponent.
                            Also added: HorizontalPanel, VerticalPanel,
                            HorizontalFrame, VerticalFrame.
                            
0.2.24      2004.07.23      Added Menu.Walk and MenuBar.Walk.
                            Added 'autoevents': if a menu item is added with
                            Menu.Append, and no event is specified, then the
                            menu item is hooked up to a dispatcher method,
                            that looks up method names dynamically. E.g. the
                            menu item "Open" in menu "File" will be associated
                            with a method Menu_File_Open, if it exists.
                            
0.2.25      2004.07.24      First step toward autopacking: Containers now have
                            a _packed attribute, which is set to 1 when Pack()
                            is called.  If Pack() is called if _packed is 1
                            already, nothing happens.  This change does not
                            affect Repack().
                            
                            Added dragdrop.TextDropTarget.  Note that as of
                            this release, explicitly using SetDropTarget is not
                            necessary anymore... FileDropTarget and TextDropTarget
                            do it automatically.  [IMPORTANT: SetDropTarget
                            should not be called twice; programs that do this
                            may crash, at least on Windows.]
                            Added examples/dragdrop-1.py to demonstrate the
                            new capabilities.
                            
0.2.26      2004.07.24      Added styles.py.  First classes to use the styles
                            are Frame, Panel and Button.  Experimental.
                            Frame and Panel now support border styles, and
                            Button supports alignment (and exactfit).
                            Added growable_rows and growable_cols parameters
                            to FlexGrid{Frame,Panel}.
                            Added a few more demos.
                            
0.2.27      2004.07.25      Container.AddComponent now allows for expand=''.
                            Added styles parameters to NoteBook.
                            
0.2.28      2004.07.30      Added styles.properties method.  For the controls
                            that allow styles, properties can now be set in
                            the constructor using the 'properties' parameter.
                            (See examples/properties-parameter-1.py.)
                            Property dicts can be set with WaxObject.SetAttributes()
                            as well.
                            From now on, 'size' parameters are DEPRECATED
                            and will be removed at some point.
                            
0.2.29      2004.08.17      Made to work with wxPython 2.5.2.7.  Incompatible
                            changes.
                            Unlike wxPython, wx.ADJUST_MINSIZE is *not* the
                            default for Wax; wx.FIXED_MINSIZE is.  In other
                            words, sizers still behave the same.
                            Updated some demos.

0.2.30      2004.08.22      Added events['HotKey'].
                            Fixed up ComboBox; it now uses styles.combobox
                            and has a new event OnTextChanged.
                            Also added a number of styles to Frame, including
                            resize (see examples/combobox-1.py).
                            
0.2.31      2004.09.04      Added 'close_box', 'minimize_box', 'maximize_box'
                            options to Frame.
                            
0.2.32      2004.09.04      Added styles to ListBox.  Updated example.

0.2.33      2004.09.17      Fixed bug in TreeView.HasChildren.
                            Added styles to TreeView.
                            
0.2.34      2004.10.27      Added first version of TreeListView.
                            Fixed bug in ImageList.Add.
                            Fixed handling of styles.treeview.
                            
0.2.35      2004.11.04      Fixed bug in directorydialog.ChooseDirectory.

0.2.36      2004.11.05      Added a bunch of styles and events to ListView.

0.2.37      2004.11.07      Added 'size' parameter to DropDownBox.__init__.
                            (The size set here will be used by certain controls,
                            like [Flex]GridSizer.  Setting the size after
                            construction won't have the same effect.  Therefore
                            'size' is not going to disappear.  Rather, more
                            controls should grow this parameter.)
                            Also added styles to DropDownBox.  (It doesn't
                            have any of its own, but can use wxWindow styles.)
                            
0.2.38      2004.11.08      Added styles for Label.
                            Label.__init__ also grows 'size' parameter (see
                            0.2.37).
                            
0.2.39      2004.11.18      Added messagedialog.ShowMessage.
                            Added core.GetActiveWindow (used by ShowMessage).
                            Added 'size' parameter to Panel.__init__.
                            
0.2.40      2004.11.26      Fixed confusing assertion error in core.py.

0.2.41      2004.12.06      grid.py now uses wx.grid.Grid.  (Part of patch by
                            Vladimir Sekissov.)
                            Removed useless "intern"s from __init__.py.
                            
0.2.42      2005.01.07      For widgets that derive from WaxObject, GetFont()
                            now returns a Wax Font, rather than a wx.Font.
                            
0.2.43      2005.01.15      Added styles to CheckBox.  New parameters: align
                            and states.  Now supports 3-state checkboxen.
                            Added distutils setup script by Neal Nelson.
                            
0.2.44      2005.01.21      MenuHistory.Add() now removes previous occurrences
                            of titles.  (Used in Firedrop2.)
                            
0.2.45      2005.01.29      Added 'noheader' option for ListView.
                            Added styles and events to Splitter.
                            
0.2.46      2005.01.30      Added ListView.[GS]etItemBackgroundColor, and.
                            [GS]etItemTextColor.
                            Added a colordb.convert_color.  All color-converting
                            methods should use this.
                            
0.2.47      2005.02.07      Added OnRightDown, OnRightUp, OnRightClick events
                            (events.py).
                            
0.2.48      2005.02.08      Added events MaxLength, TextEnter, TextMaxLen,
                            TextURL to TextBox.
                            Added styles for TextBox.
                            Added examples/textbox-justify.py.
                            
0.2.49      2005.02.13      TextEntryDialog now uses keys module and the new
                            'expand' notation.
                            Fixed buglet in Application.
                            Added examples/frame-onclose.py.
                            
0.2.50      2005.02.15      Added artprovider.py.  (First version contributed
                            by Mark Andrews; minor modifications by HN.)
                            Added examples: artprovider-1.py, bitmap-2.py,
                            bitmap-2a.py.
                            
0.2.51      2005.02.21      Changed Container.AddSpace so that if a single
                            number is passed, this is assumed to be a tuple
                            (number, number) rather than (number, -1).
                            Added customdialog.py.
                            Some refactoring in Dialog (added AddButtonPanel).
                            Added examples/customdialog-1.py.
                           
0.2.52      2005.02.24      Updated a number of examples.

0.2.53      2005.03.07      Added utils.py with asstring().  Used asstring()
                            in a few ListView methods to make them work properly
                            with unicode.  Ditto for TreeView.
                            (SF bug #1158713 by Viktor Ferenczi)

0.2.54      2005.03.16      Set report=1 as default for ListView (this used to
                            be the default in older versions).
                            Added mousepointer.py with MousePointers object.
                            Added new SetCursor() for most controls.
                            (Based on code by Mark Andrews)
                            
0.2.55      2005.03.22      Added examples/childwindow-1.py.
                            Cleaned up some code.
                            Dialog now has all the events of Frame.  Similarly,
                            CustomDialog now has all the events of Dialog.
                            Added examples/dialog-onclose-1.py.
                            
0.2.56      2005.03.29      Added examples/label-multiline-1.py.
                            Gave PlainContainer.Pack() a function: if the
                            container only has one control, it won't take up
                            all the available space (which seems to be the
                            wxPython default).
                            Moved styles from styles.py to relevant modules:
                            Button, NoteBook, ComboBox, Frame, ListBox,
                            ListView, Label, CheckBox, Splitter, TextBox,
                            TreeView.
                            Added WaxObject.SetProperties.
                            styles.properties now calls obj.SetProperties for
                            the remaining attributes.
                            
0.2.57      2005.04.01      Added LICENSE.txt and package info in __init__.py.
                            Added methods to TextBox: GetLines, SetModified, 
                            GetModified, InsertText.
                            Added examples/textbox-2.py.
                            Simplified WaxObject.GetAllChildren().
                            Added first version of waxdocgen.
                            
0.2.58      2005.04.08      Added CheckListBox.
                            Added examples/business-1.py.
                            
0.2.59      2005.04.09      Added WaxConfig.check_parent.  When set, when
                            a widget is added to a container, Wax checks if the
                            widget's parent is the same as the container (they
                            should be, in almost all cases).  If not, a 
                            warning is printed.
                            Added this to the containers, NoteBook.AddPage
                            and Splitter.Split.  (These last two *may* raise
                            an error on certain systems if the parents don't
                            match; to cover everything, I added the warning
                            anyway.)
                            (Feature suggested by Ivo van der Wijk.)
                            
0.2.60      2005.04.10      RadioButton: Added styles, cleaned up event
                            handling, some refactoring.
                            Fixed up some examples.
                            Added styles to StatusBar.  Also added example and
                            'add' parameter which adds the statusbar to the
                            parent, as an alternative to calling SetStatusBar
                            explicitly.
                            
0.2.61      2004.04.17      ComboBox, DropDownBox, ListBox and CheckListBox
                            now all have a default value choices=[], so this
                            can be omitted when creating them.
                            Added updated version of ArtProvider, by Mark
                            Andrews.  (+ updated example artprovider-1.py)
                            
0.2.62      2004.04.25      First version of WaxObject's SetWindowStyle.  First
                            used in Button.  More to come.
                            
0.2.63      2004.04.28      All classes that current support styles now have
                            all the style info (and methods) wrapped into the
                            class itself, rather than an external function.
                            Control-specific styles are now handled by a
                            _params method (every class deriving from
                            WaxObject has one).
                            All this should work with the new SetWindowStyle.
                            
0.2.64      2005.05.10      Fixed GridContainer._AllControls.  Added proportion
                            parameter (untested).  Added examples/gridpanel-5.py
                            that demonstrates how to use border together with
                            alignment.
                            Removed obsolete 'stretch' from a few examples.

0.2.65      2005.05.19      Added TreeView.LoadFromNestedList (patch by Dan
                            Crosta).  Added examples/treeview-1a.py.
                            
0.2.66      2005.05.25      Updated code to work with Python 2.2.2 (IOW,
                            removed the 2.3-isms).  Affected files are 
                            listview.py, utils.py, waxobject.py, 
                            examples/panels-1.py, waxdocgen.py.
                            
0.2.67      2005.06.03      Added support for multiversion wxPython (core.py).
                            Patch by Howard B. Golden.
                            
0.2.68      2005.06.20      Updated imageviewer.py to display a more
                            informative error message.
                            waxdocgen.py now generates a module index (patch
                            by Roy Osborne).

0.3.0       2005.07.03      The "blessed" wxPython version is now 2.6.
                            Fixed a few examples based on research by JG.
                            Removed "end of line" backslashes (combined with
                            mixed Unix/Windows line endings, they cause a
                            problem).
                            Fixed issue with version number and wxversion (new
                            in wx2.6?)
                            
0.3.1       2005.07.04      JG: Fixed examples/trayicon1.py.
                            Converted all Wax files (*.py) to Unix-style line
                            endings (so we have a uniform line ending when
                            developing on Windows and Unix).
                            Added auxiliary/fix_line_endings.py. [JG]
                            Added GetEOLMode, SetEOLMode and ConvertEOLs to
                            StyledTextBox (these methods now take or return
                            strings: 'unix', 'dos', 'mac').
                            
0.3.2       2005.07.13      Fixed problem with wxversion and VersionError if
                            wxPython is imported before wax.
                            Added 'hide_selection' option to TextBox.

0.3.3       2005.07.18      Updated CheckBox (default size etc). [JG]
                            Fixed OverlaySizer, OverlayContainer. [JG]
                            Fixed OverlayPanel.  examples/overlaypanel1.py now
                            works as it should. [JG, minor changes by HN]
                            Added auxiliary/WaxAPI.py. [JG, minor changes]
                            
0.3.4       2005.07.21      Added updated FindReplaceDialog [JG, minor changes].
                            Also updated examples/findreplacedialog1.py. [JG]
                            Removed buggy 'hide_selection' option from TextBox; 
                            wx.TE_HIDENOSEL is now on by default. [HN]
                            
0.3.5       2005.07.23      Updated versions of FindReplaceDialog and example.
                            Also works with StyledTextBox now; bugfix for
                            TextBox. [JG]
                            StyledTextBox: Added Replace, GetStringSelection
                            methods. [JG]
                            Added tools/wizard.py and example. [JG]
                            Added tools/fancylabel.py and example. [JG]
                            Added SystemSettings. [JG]
                            
0.3.6       2005.07.24      Added 'hscroll' style to TextBox.
                            dragdrop.py: Added URLDropTarget.
                            Added examples/dragdrop-2.py (based on code by JG,
                            some changes by HN).
                            Bugfix in FlexGridPanel. [Nicolas Pinault]
                            
0.3.7       2005.07.25      Updated auxiliary/fix_line_endings.py. [JG]
                            Added MenuBar.__init__, which takes an optional
                            parent, removing the need to call SetMenuBar().
                            (Again, this is optional, and the old way still
                            works.) [JG]
                            Added examples/systemsettings-1.py. [JG]
                            Updated Wizard and examples/wizard-1.py, to use
                            Body() (among other things). [JG, some changes by HN]
                            
0.3.8       2005.07.27      Added new version of WaxAPI.py, now in separate
                            directory (auxiliary/WaxAPI).  Has the capability
                            to export HTML for online documentation. [JG]
                            Removed assertion from Label.
                            
0.3.9       2005.07.29      Updated version of WaxAPI (supports choosing of
                            custom directory for HTML generation). [JG]
                            
0.3.10      2005.08.04      WaxObject: added HasStyle, GetStyleDict. [JG]
                            styles.py: added dostyle. [JG]
                            Updated examples/findreplacedialog1.py. [JG]
                            Added __styles__ to TextBox. [JG]
                            Also added it to: Button, Label. [HN]
                            Other controls will follow.  This dict is used for 
                            both setting styles and getting a style dict.
                            
0.3.11      2005.08.10      WaxAPI.py: fixed bug that displayed some names
                            twice (aliases).  Method names are now showed
                            alphabetically. [JG]

0.3.12      2005.08.14      Added examples/listview-2.py.

0.3.13      2005.08.15      Added ListItemAttr.
                            Added examples/listview-3.py. [Stefan Rank]
                            Added core.Platform.
                            Added tools/gauge.py and example. [JG]
                            Added tools/slider.py and example. [JG]
                            Added tools/spinbox.py and example. [Daniel James
                            Baker]
                            
0.3.14      2005.08.16      ScrollFrame now derives from Container (IOW, we
                            can add widgets to it like it was a Panel).
                            Added WaxObject.GetSizeX, GetSizeY.
                            
0.3.15      2005.08.18      Beefed up BitmapButton (more options, etc).

0.3.16      2005.08.26      Added tools/waxrf package.  This implements WaxRF,
                            Wax's replacement for XRC.  There's also an
                            example. [JG]
